# BloodGlucoseSpreadsheet
An Excel speadsheet for efficiently keeping a record of up to four glucose readings a day.

After downloading, change "Month 20**" at the top of the first sheet and the "Month 1" tab to the month you need. For example, if you need the month to be February 2018, change both of those to read "February 2018." Next, clear the days you don't need at the beginning of the month. For example, if you are doing either February or March 2018, you should select the first four days, from Sunday to Wednesday on the first week (the ones that say "1/1" through "1/4", and right click and select "Clear Contents," and this will clear these unneeded days. Next, since Thursday is the first day of February, go to "1/5" and change it to "2/1." This should make all the dates fall into place as dates in February, instead of January. Finally, select "3/1", "3/2", and "3/3" in the final week, right click and select "Clear Contents" so that all the dates on the chart are only from February. You have just completed a chart for a single month. Next, if you like, you can click on the "Month 2" tab and do the same for March 2018 and then the "Month 3" tab for April 2018.
